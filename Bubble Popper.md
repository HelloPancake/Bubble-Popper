## # Project Proposal: Bubble Popper
##  Background
Bubble Popper is a clone of the classic game Bubble Trouble.  The player will move and left dodging the bouncing bubbles. With a click of the spacebar the player can shoot a projectile upwards, should a bubble be hit it will proceed to split into two smaller bubbles. Once the smallest size bubble is reached, it will pop on the next hit - and once the bubbles are cleared the player will advance on to the next level

## Functionality & MVP
With Bubble Popper, users will be able to:
 Start and reset the game.
Move left and right with the arrow keys.
Listen to a music track playing, or mute it if they wish.
Instructions to the game will be available on the start game page.
A production README will also be available on github.

## Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen with a game window embedded in the center. Nav links to Github and LinkedIn will be available at the bottom of the page along with a mute button in the corner.
